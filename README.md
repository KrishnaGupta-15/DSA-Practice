2. [Binary to Decimal](#binary-to-decimal)
3. [Decimal to Binary](#decimal-to-binary)
4. [Check Prime Number](#check-prime-number)

## Butterfly Pattern
* Print a butterfly pattern using stars (`*`).

## Binary to Decimal
* Checks whether the entered number is binary or not.
*  If it is not binary, the user can re-enter the correct binary number.
* When a valid binary number is entered, the program converts it into its decimal equivalent.

## Decimal to Binary
* Converts a positive decimal integer to its binary form.

## Check Prime Number
